# CONVERSATIONS WEBAPP - Icebreakers and more
Hosted on https://conversations-pi.vercel.app/ 

In the show One Week Love, they play a game called Unfine Dining (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmzVrdrO9Z4).The game involves asking each member of a group to answer some really tough questions suggested by the card pile.

I've always wanted to make a game similar to this, as I really enjoy "tough question" games similar to "We're Not Really Strangers".Thus, I managed to build this webapp in less than a day with React Native and released it the day after this episode dropped.

Since then, it has gotten the acknowledgement of The Smart Local (show producers), as well as cast members such as Sam and Kasey.

Lastly, I have added on two additional card decks to make it an "icebreaker" themed webapp.

In total, there are three decks:
1. EXTREME ICEBREAKERS
2. UNFINE DINING
3. DATE NIGHT

I've always believed in fostering deeper relationships between individuals and thus I was quite proud of this project, hope you like it too!
